Guakify.sh
==========

This script can be used for "guakifying" any application on Linux (and possibly other Unix variants).

By 'guakifying', I mean the application can be summoned using a desired keystroke, and then made to hide in the background using the same keystroke. This is similar to how the popular Linux terminal emulator "Guake" behaves.
