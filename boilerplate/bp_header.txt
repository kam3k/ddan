#!/usr/bin/env bash
#This script "summons" the given application as mentioned in the variable `appCommand`. Class of the window of the given application is to be provided as variable `windowClass`. 
#By "summoning", we mean that running this script will either bring into focus the given application if it's not in focus, OR it will minimize the application window if it's in focus.
#You need to assign some key-binding to run this script. You can do this in "System Settings" of your graphical shell (GNOME, Unity, KDE etc.)
